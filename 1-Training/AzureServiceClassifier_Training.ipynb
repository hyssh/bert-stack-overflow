    "\n",
    "One of the key tasks to ensuring long term success of any Azure service is actively responding to related posts in online forums such as Stackoverflow. In order to keep track of these posts, Microsoft relies on the associated tags to direct questions to the appropriate support team. While Stackoverflow has different tags for each Azure service (azure-web-app-service, azure-virtual-machine-service, etc), people often use the generic **azure** tag. This makes it hard for specific teams to track down issues related to their product and as a result, many questions get left unanswered. \n",

    "**In order to solve this problem, we will build a model to classify posts on Stackoverflow with the appropriate Azure service tag.**\n",

    "We will be using a BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model which was published by researchers at Google AI Reasearch. Unlike prior language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks without substantial architecture modifications.\n",

    "## Why use BERT model?\n",
    "[Introduction of BERT model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf) changed the world of NLP. Many NLP problems that before relied on specialized models to achive state of the art performance are now solved with BERT better and with more generic approach.\n",

The system has been developed for 20 years, but it's performance was stuck at 60% on 8th grade science test. The result jumped to 90% once researchers adopted BERT as core language understanding component. With BERT Aristo now solves the test with A grade.  "
