# Create a Service Principal

Then, in the menu on the left-hand side, select "App registrations." Then select "New registration" at the top left of your screen. Name your app "tfworld_workshop" and then click "Register." You should be redirected to a screen showing the app you just created.

## Create and take note of your secret

Click "Certificates & secrets" on the left-hand side, then "New client secret." Give the secret a descriptive name, like "tensorflow_secret," then click Add.

**Make sure to take note of the secret ID now, as you will not be able to see it again**.

## Take note of the app and tenant ID

Then click on the "Overview" page on the left side and take note of the "Application (client) ID" and the "Directory (tenant) ID".

## Give your service principal access to your subscription

> Note: If you are a TensorFlow World workshop participant, you can skip this step.

You now have the information you need to log into your service principal, but your service principal itself doesn't have access to your Azure subscription. Let's fix that.

Type in the name of your subscription in the search bar on the Azure Portal. Open your subscription, and go to "Access control (IAM)" on the left-hand side.  Click "Add"->"Add role assignment" on the top left. Select the "Contributor" role, then type in the name of the service principal you just created in order to grant it access.

> Note: The next step requires you to return to [Azure DevOps](https://aex.dev.azure.com/me). Click on the name of the project you just created in order to open it up.
