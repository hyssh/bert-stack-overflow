# Create Project in ADO

## 1. Get the source code

Log in to your [Github](https://github.com/) account, or [create](https://github.com/join) one if you do not have an account. Fork this project, by clicking the "Fork" button in the top right of the Github screen.

## 2. Set up an Azure DevOps project

We use Azure DevOps to automatically create new models according to certain triggers (like if you update the code in your Github repository). 

### Create your Azure DevOps account

[Sign into your DevOps account here](https://aex.dev.azure.com/me), or [sign up for Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/).

### Create an Azure DevOps organization

Now, you need to create a new organization. Each organization can contain multiple projects, so you want to create an organization that could sensibly contain multiple related projects. Because organization names must be unique, let's leave the default organization name as is. Let the default region selection of "Central US" be unchanged. Now select "Continue."

### Create a new project

You should be automatically redirected to a screen to create a new project. Name your project "azure-bert-so" and then click "Create." Give it some description, like "Automated StackOverflow question-tagging with TensorFlow 2.0 and BERT," leave it Private, and then click "Create project."

> Note: if you ever need to create a new project in the future, click "Azure DevOps" in the top left of the DevOps window, and then "New project" in the top right of the window.

> Note: The next few steps take place in the [Azure portal](portal.azure.com), which is a **different website** from Azure DevOps.

## 3. Create a Service Principal to log in to Azure

> Note: if you are participating in the TensorFlow World workshop on October 28 and 29, 2019, you should have had a service principal created on your behalf. Check the email you received after signing up for the lab for these details.

### Open Azure Active Directory

You have now set up an Azure DevOps organization that will contain the project consisting of your StackOverflow question-tagging BERT model. Exciting! In order to access your Azure account to create resources on your behalf, Azure DevOps uses a [service principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals) to authenticate into the Azure Portal. To create a service principal, log into the [Azure portal](portal.azure.com) (**NOTE: The Azure portal is NOT the same as Azure DevOps**), click the menu icon in the top left to show the sidebar menu, and click "Azure Active Directory" on the left side of the screen.

## 4. Create an Azure Resource Manager service connection

In order to access your Azure subscription, you need an Azure Resource Manager connection in Azure DevOps.

Access the window below by clicking on "Project settings" (the gear icon in the bottom left of the Azure DevOps window).

![Project settings](./images/proj-settings.png)

Click on "Service connections." Under "New service connection" (top left), choose "Azure Resource Manager." Set "Scope level" to "Subscription" and choose your subscription.

Give the connection name **``AzureResourceConnection``** as this value is hard-coded in the pipeline definition. 

If you are a TFWorld Workshop participant, fill in the **``Resource Group``** field with the name of the Resource Group you are using, because you do not Subscription-level permissions.

## 5. Install the Azure ML marketplace extension

The pipeline you will build in the next step leverages the **Azure Machine Learning** extension to deploy your model. Go ahead and follow the [instructions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-air-aiagility.vss-services-azureml) to install this extension in your DevOps organization.

### 10. Create Azure ML service connection

Even though we created a service connection earlier in order to create resources, we need a different service connection to your workspace in order to access the trained model. To create this new service connection, go to the project settings (by clicking on the gear icon at the bottom left of the screen), and then click on **Service connections** under the **Pipelines** section:

 > Note: Creating service connection using Azure Machine Learning extension requires your user to have 'Owner' or 'User Access Administrator' permissions on the Workspace.
